# IoT Edge Data Collector Security Recommendations

## Executive Summary

**Current Issue:** Data collector has public IP address with ingress firewall restricted to Azure IP ranges only. This creates a security risk as the device is still technically reachable from the internet via Azure infrastructure.

**Recommendation:** Block ALL inbound traffic at the network/firewall level. Azure IoT Edge devices are designed to operate with outbound-only connectivity and will continue to function normally after this change.

**Key Point:** Your IoT Edge device will remain ONLINE and fully functional after blocking inbound traffic. All deployments, module updates, and telemetry will continue to work normally.

## Current Architecture

```
Internet
    ↓
Azure IP Ranges Allowed (Ingress)
    ↓
Data Collector (Public IP: Reachable only via Azure infrastructure)
    ├─ IoT Edge Runtime ($edgeAgent, $edgeHub)
    ├─ IoT Modules (Modbus collectors)
    └─ Outbound → IoT Hub + Container Registry
```

### Current Security Posture

- **Public IP:** Data collector has direct public IP address
- **Ingress Firewall:** Allows traffic only from Azure IP ranges
- **Issue:** Device is still reachable by Azure-managed services
- **Risk:** Lateral movement attack surface if Azure infrastructure is compromised

---

## Recommended Security Architecture

```
Internet
    ↓
Firewall (Block ALL Inbound)
    ↓
Data Collector (No inbound access)
    ├─ IoT Edge Runtime
    ├─ IoT Modules
    └─ Outbound → IoT Hub + Container Registry (only connection direction)
```

### Azure IoT Edge Communication Model

**Key Understanding:** Azure IoT Edge uses a PULL-based communication model:

1. **Device Initiated Connection:** The IoT Edge device establishes an outbound connection to IoT Hub
2. **Persistent Connection:** This connection stays open for receiving commands
3. **Polling Mechanism:** Device polls IoT Hub every 5-10 seconds for updates
4. **No Inbound Required:** IoT Hub does NOT initiate connections to your device

---

## How Azure IoT Edge Communication Works

### 1. Device Registration (Already Done)

```
IoT Hub maintains device registry:
  - Device ID: your-data-collector
  - Connection String/Certificates stored
  - Desired Properties stored in twin
  - Status: Can be offline or online
```

**Key Point:** Device identity exists in IoT Hub regardless of connectivity.

### 2. Device Connection (Outbound Only)

```
Data Collector:
  1. Opens OUTBOUND connection to IoT Hub
     → Connection to: *.azure-devices.net:8883 (MQTT) or 5671 (AMQP)
  2. Authenticates using connection string
  3. Maintains persistent connection
  4. Periodically polls for updates
```

### 3. Deployment Flow (Pull Model)

```
You deploy via Azure CLI:
  az iot edge set-modules --device-id collector01 --content deployment.json

What happens:
  1. Azure CLI stores manifest in IoT Hub
  2. IoT Hub stores in device's desired properties
  3. Device polls IoT Hub (checks every 5-10 seconds)
  4. Device sees new desired properties
  5. Device pulls deployment.json over OUTBOUND connection
  6. Device deploys modules locally
```

**No inbound port listening is required.**

### 4. All Twin Functionalities (Pull-Based)

- **Desired Properties:** Device polls and retrieves from IoT Hub
- **Reported Properties:** Device sends via outbound connection
- **Module Deployment:** Device pulls manifest via outbound connection
- **Module Status:** Device reports via outbound connection
- **Direct Methods:** Device receives via outbound connection (device maintains open connection)
- **Cloud-to-Device Messages:** Device receives via outbound connection

**Everything works through the device's outbound connection.**

## Device Status After Blocking Inbound

### Device Will NOT Show as Offline

**Important Clarification:** After blocking inbound traffic, your IoT Edge device will:
- ✅ Remain CONNECTED to IoT Hub
- ✅ Continue receiving deployments
- ✅ Continue sending telemetry
- ✅ Continue reporting status
- ✅ Respond to direct methods and cloud-to-device messages

### Why?

```
Before blocking inbound:
Device <-- INBOUND BLOCKED --> Internet
Device --> OUTBOUND ALLOWED --> IoT Hub ✅

After blocking inbound:
Device <-- INBOUND BLOCKED --> Internet (No change)
Device --> OUTBOUND ALLOWED --> IoT Hub ✅

Result: Same functionality, better security
```

**The device maintains its outbound connection, which is all it needs.**

## Firewall Configuration Recommendations

### Network-Level Firewall Rules (Recommended)

If you have a network firewall in front of the data collector:

```bash
# BLOCK all inbound traffic
DENY INBOUND all protocols from any source to data collector

# ALLOW outbound to IoT Hub
ALLOW OUTBOUND TCP 443 to *.azure-devices.net
ALLOW OUTBOUND TCP 8883 to *.azure-devices.net (if using MQTT)
ALLOW OUTBOUND TCP 5671 to *.azure-devices.net (if using AMQP)

# ALLOW outbound to container registries
ALLOW OUTBOUND TCP 443 to aimlsgkdchregistrydev.azurecr.io
ALLOW OUTBOUND TCP 443 to mcr.microsoft.com
```

### Windows Firewall Rules (If Needed)

On the data collector itself:

```powershell
# Block all inbound from internet
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Internet Inbound" `
    -Direction Inbound -RemoteAddress Internet -Action Block

# Allow outbound to IoT Hub
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "IoT Hub HTTPS" `
    -Direction Outbound -Action Allow `
    -RemoteAddress "*.azure-devices.net" -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 443

New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "IoT Hub MQTT" `
    -Direction Outbound -Action Allow `
    -RemoteAddress "*.azure-devices.net" -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 8883

New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "IoT Hub AMQP" `
    -Direction Outbound -Action Allow `
    -RemoteAddress "*.azure-devices.net" -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 5671

# Allow outbound to container registries
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "ACR Outbound" `
    -Direction Outbound -Action Allow `
    -RemoteAddress "aimlsgkdchregistrydev.azurecr.io" `
    -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 443

# Allow local network (for Modbus communication)
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow Local Network" `
    -Direction Inbound -Action Allow `
    -RemoteAddress "10.176.0.0/16" -Protocol Any
```

## Testing After Implementation

### Verify Device Status

```bash
# On data collector
iotedge list

# Should show all modules running
iotedge check

# Should show device CONNECTED to IoT Hub
```

### Test Deployment

```bash
# From your machine
az iot edge set-modules \
  --device-id kdch-sg-aiml-prod-collector03-0004 \
  --hub-name your-hub-name \
  --content deployment.json

# Check device receives deployment
# Wait 5-10 seconds, then:
iotedge list

# Should show new modules running
```

### Expected Results

- ✅ Device shows "CONNECTED" status
- ✅ Modules deploy successfully
- ✅ Telemetry continues to flow
- ✅ No errors in IoT Edge logs

---

## Azure IoT Hub Configuration

### No Changes Required

**Important:** You do NOT need to configure anything in Azure IoT Hub.

- IoT Hub does not need inbound connectivity
- IoT Hub does not initiate connections to devices
- IoT Hub responds to device connections
- All communication is device-initiated

### IoT Hub Capabilities

IoT Hub CAN:
- ✅ Store deployment manifests
- ✅ Store device twins and desired properties
- ✅ Receive telemetry from devices
- ✅ Receive reported properties from devices

IoT Hub CANNOT:
- ❌ Open connections TO devices
- ❌ Push data TO devices
- ❌ Initiate outbound TCP connections
- ❌ Reach out to devices behind firewalls

This is by design - IoT Hub is a passive service that responds to device-initiated connections.

---

## Migration Plan

### Step 1: Document Current State

```bash
# Check current IoT Edge status
iotedge list
iotedge check

# Document all running modules
# Note current connectivity state
```

### Step 2: Apply Firewall Rules

```bash
# Apply network firewall rules OR Windows firewall rules
# Block all inbound except local network (10.176.0.0/16)
# Allow all required outbound connections
```

### Step 3: Verify No Impact

```bash
# Wait 5-10 seconds for device to reconnect
iotedge list

# Should show all modules still running
iotedge check

# Should show CONNECTED status
```

### Step 4: Monitor

```bash
# Monitor for 24 hours to ensure stability
# Check for any connection issues
# Verify telemetry flow
# Test a module deployment
```

### Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

If you experience any issues (unlikely):

```powershell
# Remove restrictive firewall rules
Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Internet Inbound"

# Device will reconnect normally
```
